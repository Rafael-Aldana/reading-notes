# Markdown

Learning more about Markdown is important because we'll be using it all throughout the course, and it seems like an easy tool to use for web developers.

Nearly all mardown apps support basic syntax in the original markdowm design document. The syntax for creating a heading is #, for different headings add # sign up to h6. Alternate syntax for h1 === for h2 ----.
To create paragraphs you use a blank line. If you want to create a different paragraph use a another blank line leaving one blank line in between them. With Markdown you can pretty much do everything you can with with HTML without the customizations CSS provides.
