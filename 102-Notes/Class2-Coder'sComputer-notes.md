# Coder's Computer

The importance of having a good text editor is because it comes down to which ever one the developer is more comfortable with. A text editor allows a developer to write and manage text, ie. text that helps you write a website. So if the developer is not familiar with the text editor friction might arise when they try build a website.

It comes down to shooter' preference as we would say in the army. this reminded me of the way we ran things in my old infantry company, the CO would always say run your rifles and Kits by shooter's prefference. This meant that we could arange our rifles and body armor the way we found most useful and what made us faster in combat.

Using the terminal: the terminal is like your files folder on your computer. The only diefference is that in the terminal you have use terminal commands to get to where you want to be, as opposed to your files the programming has user interface where you use your mouse to click and move throughout the files.



## Things I want to know more about:

I want to learn more terminal commands such as.
cd 
merge
touch
