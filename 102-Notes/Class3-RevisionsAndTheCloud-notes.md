# Revisions and the Cloud

Git is arguably one of the most important pieces of software that we have because its where the cloud stores our projects. There we can share our projects and have others look at them and share work with others.

First thing that i learned is that github is not git it is only where we can have access to it.
It is the foundation for collaborative work. You can copy your work from the cloud into your local terminal by using the git clone command followed by the url link. To push updates from your teminal to the cloud you git push origin. To pull changes to the file made on the cloud you git pull. You can view what's on your tree with the git tree command. The most used command for us will be git status, git add, git commit -m, git push origin main.
