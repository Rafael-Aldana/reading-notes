# Structure Web Pages With HTML

The main reason why HTML is one of the most important tools that web developers use is because it allows them to create the structure of the website. It allows the human eye to visually see what's going on in the code. I like how code fellows is also teaching us beginers the best practices that are being used out in the field today.

HTML uses elements to write the code for a web pages. It uses <tags>, always has an opening tag and closing tag. Each element has a different meaning ex. <h1> is a heading tag, <p> is for paragraphs, different <inputs> types <input type = "email">
Each tag has different atributes and values.
