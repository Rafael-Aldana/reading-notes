# Design Web Pages With CSS

CSS is probably the most important thing about a website because it's how the information is presented. I think no matter how good a website can be with information if it's not displayed properly it can turn consumers away. This is especially important nowadays because of how much we use the internet on an every day basis. I know I have been vivtim of going to a site and staying because it either had great pictures or something done through CSS to grasp my attention. I like to think about it as presenting a steak you wouldn't present the sides first you'd want to grab their attention with that big juicy steak.

The way that the website looks when it is rendered is through CSS you can use CSS in line or through an external file. You can modify backgrounds <brackground-color: "color-of-choice">. CSS can also be used to modify pictures such as the width, the height, the borders, you tell it float. You can even modify the color of the text through CSS. I'm a very visual person so CSS is by far my favorite program.
