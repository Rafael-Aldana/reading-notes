# Dynamic Web Pages With JavaScript

JavaScript is a very important programming language because without it there would be no user input. Yeah CSS makes the website that was created through HTML look presentable but if we want to have the users have interactions at certain levels we can't make that happen without JavaScript it completes a good website.

Now a days almost every website out there you see has some form of JavaScript at certain levels. JavaScript "is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well."(mdn web docs). The language is able to make if statements, for & while loops, and switch and catch blocks. One cool thing about JS is that if you code an object that code can be used as a blueprint for creating future similar objects. The current version of JS run on ECMA-262 edition 5 and later versions. To write JS you can either do it in line or like we learned in CSS is can also be its own file for best practice. To input JS you write <script></script> in HTML. To create a pop up in a website you create an alert! Alert(). A great tool JS provides is the console.log command, developers out in the field use for debugging websites. They can see anything from errors in the code syntax or errors that occur during executions.


## Things that I want to learn more about:

I would like to dig further into the document.write and console.log commands.
