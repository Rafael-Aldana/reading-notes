# Programming with JavaScript


Knowing the proper function commands and having the basic knowledge of JS and coding with it is crucial because a well rounded developer knows the programs he/she/them is working with. Having that knowledge gives you that confidence you'll need for people to rely on you and request your work.

A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.

For example, the above excerpt might be inside a function that runs when the user clicks the Submit button for the form. The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. Looking back at the code in the if and else sections, the lines prompt User and submit Form could also be calls to other functions in the script. As you can see, control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code.


Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.[ControlFlow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow).

JavaScript has functions, a function is a block of code created to execute a particular task. A function is executed when something invokes it other way known as calling. Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. A function looks like: ex. function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    //code to be executed
}
Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses.
Function arguments are the values recieved by the funtion when it is invoked.
A function can be invoked by the following: when an event occurs, when it is invoked, automatically. Functions have a return statement when the code reaches a return statement the function will stop executing. If the function is invoked from a statement, JS will return to execute the code after the invoking statement.
