Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Syntax erros are simple spelling errors in the code that cause the code not to run at all, error messages are usually provided. Logic errors happen when the syntax is correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that the program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These errors usually don't have message errors to direct you to the source of the source.

List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them. The two most common errors I've encountered are the undefined and syntax error. The unddefined error is fixed by going to that line of code and defining that specific block of code and the syntax error is some times just a simple comma thats missing.

How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
The ability to know what type of error is which is very useful because it'll make debugging that much easier knowing where to start is much better than shooting in the dark.

How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
The JavaScript Debugger tool is a simple yet very useful feature that almost all browsers have. You can access it by using the inspect feature or by going into the menu and clicking on the developer tools. There you can see your code and it allows you to run lines of JavaScript against the page currently loaded in the browser and reports the errors encountered as the browser tries to execute your code.

Define what a breakpoint is.
Breakpoints are places in your code where you can pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

What is the call stack?
The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
