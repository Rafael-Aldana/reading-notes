Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
As a developer I would use a local storage to store a user's session, this means that if you close an application on your desktop and re-open it its most recent state will be restored.
What information should not be stored in local storage?
Personal information and sensitive information should not be stored in local storages.
Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
Local storages can only store data strings. You can convert different types of data into strings by using the JSON.stringify() key.
