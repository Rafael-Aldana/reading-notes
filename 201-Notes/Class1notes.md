# Class 01 code-201d93

The different topics that this class goes over is a summarized version of what we went over in code 102. All of the topics are important because we will only build from our aquired skills.

HTTP is like a cashier at your favorite fast food restaurant. You request your favorite burger and HTTP goes to the server and requests what you asked for. If the server says they can give you what you asked for it is put together for you in a bag and brought back to you so you can enjoy that tasty burger.

The way a browser parses differe requests is by first requesting a HTML file then it sends requests for any links that are attached to it starting with a CSS file then moving on to a script file for JAVASCRIPT.

To add an image to your website you first go to google make sure that there are no copy right violations on the image. Then you save the image as something you'll remember it by. Then you use the <img src= "" alt="">  tag to insert it.

In order to create a string or a number, you use the var, let, or cosnt. The difference between them is that in a string you put the string inside double quotes or single quotes.

A variables are containers that store values in JavaScript.

An HTML attribute is a placeholder that contains extra information about the element.

The anatomy of an HTML element is simple everything has an opening and closing tag ex: <p>words with importance</p>

The main difference between an article and a section in HTLM is that an article is used to wrap independent and self contained content. On the other hand a section is used to divide thematically defined pieces.

Elements that a typical website includes are: 
<header>
<nav>
<main>
<footer>

The metadata influences optimization by storing data of your website that is not displayed in the fornt end like data about the HTML document, important keywords that describe the document and the author, amongst many other things.

The <meta> tag is used along side with specific attributes to describe different things the webpage can do for ex: <meta charset="utf-8"> this means that the website can run any human language.

The first step to building a website is to first decide what you want to accomplish. 
The most important thing to answer is what is it that you hope to accomplsih with your website.

You should use h1 level headings on your title because that element is a semantic which makes the text wrap around the meaning of top level heading on the page. As opposed to a span tag it has no semantic so your title might not look as important if you're not careful.

The benifits of using semantice tags in HTML are that it makes easier for search engines to consider what you have on your page. And it is easier for humans to see the code.

Two things that require JavaScript are browser API'S and THIRD PARTY API'S
Browser API's are built into your web browser and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment. Third party API's are not built into the browser by default but you generally have to grab their code and information from somewhere in the web.
You can add JavaScript to aN HTML file through in line coding or through an external file.
