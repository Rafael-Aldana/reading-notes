The importance of why we as software developers must use semantic elements in our HTML code is because it makes the code easier to read with our human eyes. It aslo makes it easier to catch errors in the code and if the code is shared other developers can read the code with ease.

In HTML there are six levels of headings. They are H1-H2-H3-H4-H5-H6 beginning with H1 being the highest level or most important one and moving down all the way to H6.

Some uses for the <sup> and <sub> tags are very different. Whereas <sub> is subscripts texts can be used in chemical formulas. On the other hand <sup> is used for things like when writing math equations like square roots and so forth.

When using the <abbr> tag you must first write the full written word followed by the tag for the abbreviation.

Primarily there are three ways we can apply CSS to our HTML. Inline coding is when there's CSS code with the HTML code line. Internal is when the CSS is maybe in the head or header of the HTML file. Finally external is when there's an external file for the CSS styling sheet it is it's own file.

It is best practice to avoid inline style of CSS because it is messy and makes the code much harder to read. Therefore making it twice as hard to detect errors when they occur.

h2 {                 Here in this example the h2 is the selector.
  color: black;        The CSS declarations are color: black and padding: 5px
  padding: 5px;          finally the properties are color and padding.
}

The data type that uses single quotes is the string.

Four types of operators are:
Comparison operators
Logical Operators
String Operators
Assignment Operators

We can use a function to describe is me being tired. We can use if then or if else functions to get to the bottom of it.
if (I am tired) {
  take a nap;
} else if(I am hungry) {
  eat;
} else {
  drink water
}

An if statement checks a variable and if it evaluates to true then the code block will execute.

The use of the else if statement is used when the initial if statement is not executed to be true then the if else statement is then ran.

Comparison operators:
!=
==
>

The difference between logical operators && and || are that the && can be false even when theres a true declaration in this operator all the declarations must be true. On the other hand the || logical operator only one declaration can be true and the other one false for the function to be true it is independent.
