# Class 03 code-201d93

This three reading assaignments are especially important to us because it's what we will be going over in class today. And there will things from the reading that we'll have to apply the lab we are going to be doing.

HTML
In HTML you should use unordered list when you are trying to make a list in which the order of the content does not matter. It is typically displayed with bullet points.
To change the bullet styles you can either make sub catergories in the <ul> or in the CSS stylesheet.

You should use <ol> when the list you are creating is meaningful and the content has a priority from highest to lowest. 
Two ways you can change the numbers in an <ol> are by placing a type on the list ex:
<ol type="i"> or <ol type="a">
<ol type="I"> or <ol type="A">

CSS
The role of padding in CSS is the white space surrounding the content as white space
The role of marging is the outermost layer wrapping all of the content including other CSS elements.
The four parts of an HTML box element are the margin, border, padding, and the content.
1.The marging box is the outermost box wrapping around the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements. Customize it with: margin: ;

2.The border box wraps around the content and any padding. Customize it with: border: ;

3.The padding is the box that sits around the content as white space. Customize it with: padding: ;

4.The content box is the area where your content is displayed. Customize it with: inline-size: ; and block: ; or width: ; and height: ;.

JS
The data types that an array can store are integers, vectors, matrices, and other arrays.
The array:
const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]]; cannot be accessed because null is not a valid datatype that can be stored in an array. 

Five shorthand operators for assaignment: x = f(), x +=(), x -= f(), x *= f(), x /= f().

let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;
 The return value would be 10 because a is the only variable that has been assigned.

 Conditional statements are best used for when a certain condition needs to be true. ex: if (speed > 80 mph) {
  alert("Slow down");
 }

 A loop would be useful when you want to greet a certain number of people.
