The importance of knowing how to use images/media in websites is fundamental because they provide the content that extra it factor to grab the user's attention. I like to think about it like adding spices to a recipe.

The alt element would be used if a user has a disability and is relying on a screen reader to read out the content for them.

You can increase the accessibilty of an image by adding links, titles, and customizing the height and width of an image.

A figure would be useful when you have several images in your website.

A gif is like any other image formats it is not resolution independent and it will look pixelated when scaled up or viewed on higher resolutions. On the other hand sgv's are scalable and resolution independent.

The best image formats for screenshots would be WebP if compression is going to be an issue. And PNG if compression won't be a problem.

Foreground colors i.e color is used to customize text color and any other text decorations. The background color is color behind the text.

I would use CSS to change the background color. Add text color to different ol and ul. Scale images to fit properly in the page. And add some extra colors to the h1.

You should consider the readability, web safe fonts so that web browsers can display your content.

Font-size: It sets the size of the fonts across the HTML document. The default font size is 16px
Font-weight: Is used to set how bold text is.
Font-style: Is used to turn italic on or off.

To add spacing to characters you can use the word- and letter- spacing.
