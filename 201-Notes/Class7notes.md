Domain modeling constructors and object prototypes are all important in the overall way that a website runs. Without it the interface would  be less customizable.

The reason why we need domain modeling is it creates a conceptual model of a specific problem, and a domain can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

TABLES should not be used for layouts bcause it makes the code less accessable for visually inpaired readers, tables create a tag wreck inability to read, write, maintain, and debug the code. And finally tables are not automatically responsive.

3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table:
form: collects users input
table: allows the collection of data and puts it into rows and columns of cells.
article: is independent, self contained content. The content should makes sense on its own independently form the rest of the site.

A constructor is just a function call using the 'new' keyword. You can take advantage of constructors when you need to create new similar objects with the same properties and methods.

Objects created using object literal are singletons, this means when a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script. Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change won't affect the object throughout the script

Prototype and inheritance is like falling in on used equiptment and fighting positions from a previous unit. You will be using their standard operating procedures when you replace them.
