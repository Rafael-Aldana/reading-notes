# MongoDB and Mongoose

This reading topic is important because mongoDB and mongoose are going to the two new things we'll be focusing on for this week.

## nosql vs sql
Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL- Data uses Schemas/ Relations/Data is distributed acrross multiple tables/ Horizontal scaling is difficult: impossible; Vertical scaling is possible/ Limitations for lots of read and write queries per second.
NOSQL- Schema-less/ No Relations/ Data is typically merged-nested in a few collections/ Both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible/ great performance for more simple read and write requests.

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Complex databases

Give a real world example.


What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Hierarchical data

Give a real world example.


Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
 NOSQL

Which type of database is best for scalability?
SQL

## sql vs nosql video

What does SQL stand for? 
Structured query language

What is a relational database?
 Works with certain assumptions and it supports the sql that works with data tables.

What type of structure does a relational database work with?
It works with table structure.
One-to-one structure
One-to-many structure
Many-to-many structure


What is a ‘schema’?
All recorsds need to adhere to the schema 

What is a NoSQL database?
It is a data base that uses collections instead of tables.
Uses documents instead of rows and there is no schema.
There is no relations as well.

How does it work?
It is more flexible than using sql because it is easier to use.

What is inside of a MongoDB database?
Nosql database.

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
MongoDB is more flexible than sql because it is easier to use and uses no schema, no relations.

Scaling can become very hard as opposed to horizontal.
