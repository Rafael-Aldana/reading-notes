## SPEED CODING Building a CRUD API

Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
All CRUD methods relate to the functionalities of the application example; when you create some data you'll be wanting to read it, once you read you mighnt want to update it to reflect specific instances of the application, finally when you want to delete an instance of the application you delete.

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. Add all of your add on files or libraries and database
2. Set up your basic CRUD app skeleton
3. Set up your REST framework routes and Schema
4. Create your application 
5. send your request to the API database
