## Eployee breakdown of key technology companies/ Why diversity matters to your tech company

When are diversity efforts most successful?
Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders.

Why do diverse companies perform better?
According to Scott E. Page, professor of complex systems, political science and economics at the University of Michigan: "Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."
