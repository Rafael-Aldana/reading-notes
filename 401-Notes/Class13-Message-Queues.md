# Message Queues

## Socket.io Chat Example

1. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.


2. What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?


3. Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?


## Rooms

1. What is a room and how might a room be useful?
2. How do you join a room?
3. How do you leave a room?

## Namespaces

1. What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?

2. Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)

3. Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces
