# Event Driven Architecture

## Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.

Going off of one of the podcasts I listened to, the problem domain was that the world wide shipping container system is so outdated I would like to see if we can replicate it on the terminal with modern software.

The second choice would be making a chat room app that allows users to join individual rooms and talk to one another.

## Reflection

  What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
Have the base knowledge of using socket.io and using namespaces and joining rooms. I at least want to be able to recognize what that looks like in code.
