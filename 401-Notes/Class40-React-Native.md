# React Native

## getting started with react native

Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.

1. <View>	<ViewGroup>	<UIView>	A non-scrolling <div>	A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls.
2. <Text>	<TextView>	<UITextView>	<p>	Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events.
3. <Image>	<ImageView>	<UIImageView>	<img>	Displays different types of images.

What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?

React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.

In Android development, you write views in Kotlin or Java; in iOS development, you use Swift or Objective-C. With React Native, you can invoke these views with JavaScript using React components. At runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components. Because React Native components are backed by the same views as Android and iOS, React Native apps look, feel, and perform like any other apps. We call these platform-backed components Native Components.

React Native comes with a set of essential, ready-to-use Native Components you can use to start building your app today. These are React Native's Core Components.

React Native also lets you build your own Native Components for Android and iOS to suit your app’s unique needs.

What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?

What solution does expo provide?



Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.
