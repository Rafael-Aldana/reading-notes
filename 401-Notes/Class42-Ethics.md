Coming from a military background I have abided to the uniform code of military justice (UCMJ) for the past 7 years. And reading this article I was actually really taken back by the amount of ethics or regulations that sofware developers abide by. I never new that there were code of ethics that are being practiced by professionals and I am also relieved by how many of them are for protection of the average developer.

After reading this article to me it seems like they are taking the usual skynet takes over the world scenerio. Yes I do think that our technology is developing at an outstanding rate, but with this we as a human species can either use it for the greater good of humanity or let it go over our heads and let it control us. The argument they made that big brother is using this new technology to coerce people into doing things the way they want is old news. The government has been and will keep monitoring our use of the internet. As a species we will have to have a level of maturity to use this technology to further enhance our quality of life instead of heading down the doomsday route. I have faith that we as humans will learn to live with technology as an enhacer not a hindrace. I am well aware that technology and automation will also take many peoples jobs, but also create new ones for people who are invsioners and maintenance.
