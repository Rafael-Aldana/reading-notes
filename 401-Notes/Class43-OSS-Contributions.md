### Look over the above content.

Teach us two things about Next.js.

- Next.js. aims to solve Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

- Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
Development environment with Fast Refresh support
API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
Fully extendable
Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.

Teach us two things about Gatsby.js.

- Gatsby provides starter templates 

- In Gatsby, CMS stands for Content Management System. It refers to a tool or platform used to create, manage, and publish digital content, such as blog posts, articles, or web pages, without requiring advanced technical knowledge or skills. Gatsby is a static site generator that can be used with various CMSs, such as WordPress, Contentful, or Strapi, to source and render content and build fast and optimized websites. The CMS provides an interface for content creators and editors to add, modify, and delete content, while Gatsby generates the final static website that can be deployed to a web server or a content delivery network (CDN).
