# Authorization/Authentication

## Read todayâ€™s Lab Requirements

The two ideas I have for the lab are:

1. A system management server that allows workers to take a look at inverntory and send up requests for parts to a manager.
The worker will have read capabilities. While the manager can create, read the database, update the database, and delete items from the database.
2. Pet Rescue that screens users and has multiple pet options (dog, cat, maybe more) possibly accommodating more specific human/animal needs or preferences. Users, Dogs, & Cats tables might exist with relations. A 3rd party API could be used to find actual adoptable pets in the users area.
