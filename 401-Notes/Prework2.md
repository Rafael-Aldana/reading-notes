## Emotional Intelligence

From the assessment questions the results show that I need improvement in self-awareness and self-managemet. I came in with a score of 18 in both of these areas, which I thought they were my strongest qualities but the results say otherwise. I want to start asking my instructor/peers for feedback and ask for mentoring from those who I strive to be like.

## Bias Self-Assessment

The strongest area for me was the WHAT IS BIAS and MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS sections of the assessment.
The weakest areas for me were FOUR WAYS TO ACT, EFFECTIVE COURAGE, EMPATHY AND CURIOSITY, AND CONNECT TO MITIGATE BIAS. These are the areas I need to improve on. I have always struggled to push myself to my full potential. I self sabotage without me really even noticing until I'm in trouble or I have screwed something up terribly. My goal for this final course is to push myself to get out of comfort zone and do things that I fear doing the most.
