# Data Structures and Algorithms

This reading topic is important because without the ability to solve data structures or algorithms you can't pass an interview.

## Discussion Questions

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
You have to decide which data structure will provide the best performance.

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
We can avoid this problem by creating a base recursive case and a recursive case for each data structure.

### Things I want to know more about: 

I want to know more about whiteboarding a data structure code and using pseudo-code to solve a problem.

What are some techniques that I can start applying here at 401 in the eaerly stages of my course and of my career.

How do I know I am applying the correct pseudo-code to a data structure.
