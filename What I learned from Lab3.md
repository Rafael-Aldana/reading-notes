# What I learned from LAB 3 

This lab taught me the importance of the ACP process and the git status.
I saw how much I used git status and realized that Kassie was right this is like salt you use it more than any other spice. I learned how to make folders in VS Code as well as creating new files in this program, all of this will come in in handy for the next classes to come.
